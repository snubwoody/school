## Composition of linear transformations

In many situations, we want to apply several linear transformations, one after another. Similar to calculus where, given two functions $f$ and $g$, it is possible to define a function $f \circ g = f(g(x))$, we can also define composite linear transformations.

Let $T:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p$ and $S:\mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be linear transformations. The **composition** $S \circ T:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is defined by $$(S \circ T)(\textbf{v}) = S(T(\text{v}))$$.
