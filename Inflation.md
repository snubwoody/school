The **quantum theory of money** serves two purposes: First, it outlines the general relationship between money, velocity, real GDP and prices; second, it highlights the crucial role of the money supply in determining the price level.

Let's consider a simple example. Suppose you receive monthly income of $\$5000$ and spent the entire $\$5000$ every month. In a year you would spent $\$60,000$ ($\$12,000$ 5 times). We can also calculate your yearly total by adding up all the goods and services you purchase and multiplying by their prices. This relationship can be expressed as an identity
$$M \times V = P \times Y$$
In this equation 
- $M$ represents the money you paid
- $V$ is the **velocity of money** (the number of times you spend $M$ in a year) 
- $P$ denotes price 
- $Y$ is a measure of the quantity of goods and services you buy

A similar identity applies to the nation as a whole, where 
- $M$ is the money supply 
- $V$ is the average number of times a dollar is spent on final goods and services 
- $P$ is the price level (measured by the GDP deflator)  
- $Y$ is the quantity of good and services purchased (real GDP).

Given that $M \times V$ represents total spending on final goods and services and $P \times Y$ is the price level times real GDP, the two sides of this equation are equal to the nominal GDP.

## The cause of inflation
To understand how money affects real GDP and prices we make two assumptions: both real GDP ($Y$) and velocity ($V$) are relatively stable compared to the money supply $M$. 

If real GDP $(Y)$ and velocity $(V)$ are stable, then it follows from the equation that the only factor that increases the price level $P$ is the money supply $M$. In other words, *inflation is primarily caused by an increase in the money supply*.

We can express the quantity theory of money in terms of growth rates
$$\Delta M + \Delta V = \Delta P + \Delta Y$$
Assuming velocity remains relatively constant, $\Delta V$ will be close to zero. Additionally, the growth rate of real GDP ($\Delta Y$) is typically zero, ranging from $2\%$ to $8\%$. So the quantity of money theory suggests that the *growth rate of the money supply will be roughly equal to the inflation rate*. 

## Money neutrality
The concept of **money neutrality** states that changes in the money supply have no long-term effects on real variables such as real GDP. However, changes to real GDP can affect real GDP in the short-run. Under certain circumstances, an increase in real GDP can temporarily boost real GDP, while a decrease can temporarily reduce it.

### The fisher effect
We need to recall the difference between real and nominal interest rates. The nominal interest rate is the one you'll see at your local bank. If you have a savings account, the nominal interest rate tells you how quickly your account will grow in terms of dollars. The real interest rate, on the other hand, takes into account the effects of inflation, showing you how fast the actual purchasing power of your savings will increase. Here's how we calculate the real interest rate. 
$$\text{Real interest rate} = \text{Nominal interest rate} - \text{Inflation rate}$$
In the long run, when money is neutral, changes in money growth shouldn't impact the real interest rate since it's a real variable. For the real interest to not be affected the nominal interest rate must be adjusted, so if the Bank of Canada decides to increase the rate of money growth, it will lead to both higher inflation and higher interest rates. This one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the rate of inflation is known as the **fisher effect**.
